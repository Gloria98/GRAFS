As part of the examination, participants were asked to provide information on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-like-symptoms, information on sociodemographic characteristics and workplace risk factors for a SARS-CoV-2 infection and any prior COVID-19 infection. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were performed and seroprevalence estimates were adjusted for test sensitivity and specificity. \nRESULTS: The test-adjusted seroprevalence was 4% (95% CI 3.1-6.2) and the underascertainment rate was 2.3. Of those tested SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive, 41% were aware that they had been infected in the past. Seropositivity was elevated among paramedics who worked in the emergency rescue team providing first level of pre-hospital emergency care (6% [95% CI 3.4-8.6]) and those directly exposed to a COVID-19 case (5% [95% CI 3.5-8.1]). Overall, the seroprevalence and the underascertainment rate were higher among first responders than among the general population. \nCONCLUSIONS: The high seroprevalence and underascertainment rate highlight the need to mitigate potential transmission within and between first responders and patients. Workplace control measures such as increased and regular COVID-19-testing and the prompt vaccination of all personnel are necessary. \n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.

However, inaccurate results may occur due to false negatives (FN) caused by polymorphisms or point mutations related to the virus evolution and compromise the accuracy of the diagnostic tests. Therefore, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics should be evaluated and evolve together with the rapidly increasing number of new variants appearing around the world. However, even by using a large collection of samples, laboratories are not able to test a representative collection of samples that deals with the same level of diversity that is continuously evolving worldwide. In the present study, we proposed a methodology based on an in silico and in vitro analysis. First, we used all information offered by available whole-genome sequencing data for SARS-CoV-2 for the selection of the two PCR assays targeting two different regions in the genome, and to monitor the possible impact of virus evolution on the specificity of the primers and probes of the PCR assays during and after the development of the assays. Besides this first essential in silico evaluation, a minimal set of testing was proposed to generate experimental evidence on the method performance, such as specificity, sensitivity and applicability. Therefore, a duplex reverse-transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) method was evaluated in silico by using 154 489 whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains that were representative for the circulating strains around the world. The RT-ddPCR platform was selected as it presented several advantages to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples and wastewater.

Rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants provides crucial information concerning the outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 variants and possible lines of transmission. This information is vital for infection prevention and control. We used a Cas12a-based RT-PCR combined with CRISPR on-site rapid detection system (RT-CORDS) platform to detect the key mutations in SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as 69/70 deletion, N501Y, and D614G. We used type-specific CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to identify wild-type (crRNA-W) and mutant (crRNA-M) sequences of SARS-CoV-2. We successfully differentiated mutant variants from wild-type SARS-CoV-2 with a sensitivity of 10-17\u00a0M (approximately 6 copies/\u03bcL). The assay took just 10\u00a0min with the Cas12a/crRNA reaction after a simple RT-PCR using a fluorescence reporting system. In addition, a sensitivity of 10-16\u00a0M could be achieved when lateral flow strips were used as readouts. The accuracy of RT-CORDS for SARS-CoV-2 variant detection was 100% consistent with the sequencing data.

The disease was the largest cause of death in the United States in early 2021. Likewise, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for rapid and accurate diagnoses at scales larger than ever before. To improve the availability of current gold standard diagnostic testing methods, the development of point-of-care devices that can maintain gold standard sensitivity while reducing the cost and providing portability is much needed. In this work, we combine the amplification capabilities of reverse transcriptase loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) techniques with high-sensitivity end-point detection of crumpled graphene field-effect transistors (cgFETs) to develop a portable detection cell. This electrical detection method takes advantage of the ability of graphene to adsorb single-stranded DNA due to noncovalent \u03c0-\u03c0 bonds but not double-stranded DNA. These devices have demonstrated the ability to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a range from 10 to 104 copies/\u03bcL in 20 viral transport medium (VTM) clinical samples. As a result, we achieved 100% PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity with 10 positive and 10 negative VTM clinical samples. Further, the cgFET devices can differentiate between positive and negative VTM clinical samples in 35 min based on the Dirac point shift.

At the time of this study, the number of infected people in the United States is the highest globally (31.2 million infections). Within the infected population, patients diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are in more life-threatening circumstances, resulting in severe respiratory system failure. Various studies have investigated the infections to COVID-19 and ARDS by monitoring laboratory metrics and symptoms. Unfortunately, these methods are merely limited to clinical settings, and symptom-based methods are shown to be ineffective. In contrast, vital signs (e.g., heart rate) have been utilized to early-detect different respiratory diseases in ubiquitous health monitoring. We posit that such biomarkers are informative in identifying ARDS patients infected with COVID-19. In this study, we investigate the behavior of COVID-19 on ARDS patients by utilizing simple vital signs. We analyze the long-term daily logs of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) associated with 150 ARDS patients admitted to five University of California academic health centers (containing 77,972 samples for each vital sign) to distinguish subjects with COVID-19 positive and negative test results. In addition to the statistical analysis, we develop a deep neural network model to extract features from the longitudinal data. Our deep learning model is able to achieve 0.81 area under the curve (AUC) to classify the vital signs of ARDS patients infected with COVID-19 versus other ARDS diagnosed patients. Since our proposed model uses only the BP and HR, it would be possible to review data prior to the first reported cases in the U.S. to validate the presence or absence of COVID-19 in our communities prior to January 2020.

By quantifying the affected area of the lung parenchyma, severity score was evaluated for each lobe of the lung with the DL-based algorithm. The diagnosis was based on the total lung severity score ranging from 0 to 25. The data were randomly split into a 40% training set and a 60% test set. Optimal cut-off value was determined using Youden-index method on the training cohort. \nRESULTS: A total of 1259 patients were enrolled in this study. The prevalence of RT-PCR positivity in the overall investigated period was 51.5%. As compared to RT-PCR, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy on the test cohort were 39.0%, 80.2%, 68.0%, 55.0% and 58.9%, respectively. Regarding the whole data set, when adding those with positive RT-PCR test at any time during hospital stay or \"COVID-19 without virus detection\", as final diagnosis to the true positive cases, specificity increased from 80.3% to 88.1% and the positive predictive value increased from 68.4% to 81.7%. \nCONCLUSION: DL-based CT severity score was found to have a good specificity and positive predictive value, as compared to RT-PCR.

The COVID-19 pandemic served as an opportunity to evaluate whether the Index contained the correct array of variables that influence countries' abilities to respond to these threats; assess additional variables that may influence preparedness; and examine how the impact of preparedness components change during public health crises. \nMETHODS: Linear regression models were examined to determine the relationship between excess mortality per capita for the first 500 days of countries' COVID-19 pandemic and internal Index variables, as well as external variables including social cohesion; island status; perceived corruption; elderly population size; previous epidemic experience; stringency of non-pharmaceutical interventions; and social and political polarisation. \nRESULTS: COVID-19 outcomes were significantly associated with sociodemographic, political and governance variables external to the 2019 Index: social cohesion, reduction in social polarisation and reduced perceptions of corruption were consistently correlated with reduced excess mortality throughout the pandemic. The association of other variables assessed by the Index, like epidemiological workforce robustness, changed over time. Fixed country features, including geographic connectedness, larger elderly population and lack of prior coronavirus outbreak experience were detrimental to COVID-19 outcomes. Finally, there was evidence that countries that lacked certain capacities were able to develop these over the course of the pandemic. \nCONCLUSIONS: Additional sociodemographic, political and governance variables should be included in future indices to improve their ability to characterise preparedness. Fixed characteristics, while not directly addressable, are useful for establishing countries' inherent risk profile and can motivate those at greater risk to invest in preparedness. Particular components of preparedness vary in their impact on outcomes over the course of the pandemic, which may inform resource direction during ongoing crises. Future research should seek to further characterise time-dependent impacts as additional COVID-19 outcome data become available. \n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

It is an invaluable tool for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in critically ill patients in intensive care unit (ICU). Less is known about its role outside the ICU, particularly in the intermediate care unit (IMCU), a specialized environment, where an intermediate grade of intensive care and monitoring between standard care unit and ICU is provided. In the IMCU, the leading indications for a diagnostic work-up are: To visualize airway system/obstructions, perform investigations to detect respiratory infections, and identify potential sources of hemoptysis. The main procedures for therapeutic purposes are secretion aspiration, mucus plug removal to solve atelectasis (total or lobar), and blood aspiration during hemoptysis. The decision to perform FB might depend on the balance between potential benefits and risks due to frailty of critically ill patients. Serious adverse events related to FB are relatively uncommon, but they may be due to lack of expertise or appropriate precautions. Finally, nowadays, during dramatic recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the exact role of FB in COVID-19 patients admitted to IMCU has yet to be clearly defined. Hence, we provide a concise review on the role of FB in an IMCU setting, focusing on its indications, technical aspects and complications. \n\u00a9The Author(s) 2021.

The MHA-CoroCapsule consists of convolutional layers, two capsule layers, and a non-iterative, parameterized multi-head attention routing algorithm is used to quantify the relationship between the two capsule layers. The experiments are performed on a combined dataset constituted by two publicly available datasets including normal, non-COVID pneumonia and COVID-19 images. The model achieves the accuracy of 97.28%, recall of 97.36%, and precision of 97.38% even with a limited number of samples. The experimental results demonstrate that, contrary to the transfer learning and deep feature extraction approaches, the proposed MHA-CoroCapsule has an encouraging performance with fewer trainable parameters and does not require pretraining and plenty of training samples."], "journal": "IEEE Trans Med Imaging", "journal_id": "8310780", "date": "2021-12-09T00:00:00Z", "abstract_sen": "[0, 23, 39, 64, 85, 115, 143, 164, 185, 221]", "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[3, 3, \"C5203670;T047;840539006\", \"COVID-19\"], [17, 17, \"C0460139;T033;13543005\", \"pressure\"], [40, 40, \"C0011900;T060;439401001\", \"diagnosis\"], [47, 47, \"C5203670;T047;840539006\", \"COVID-19\"], [50, 51, \"C0039985;T060;399208008\", \"chest X-ray\"], [63, 63, \"C0011900;T060;439401001\", \"diagnosis.\"], [69, 70, \"C0039985;T060;399208008\", \"chest X-ray\"], [73, 73, \"C0332218;T033;52925006\", \"difficult\"], [92, 92, \"C0006935;T122;385049006\", \"capsule\"], [109, 109, \"C5203670;T047;840539006\", \"COVID-19\"], [112, 113, \"C0039985;T060;399208008\", \"chest X-ray\"], [122, 122, \"C0006935;T122;385049006\", \"capsule\"], [141, 141, \"C0006935;T122;385049006\", \"capsule\"], [160, 160, \"C0032285;T047;233604007\", \"pneumonia\"], [162, 162, \"C5203670;T047;840539006\", \"COVID-19\"], [198, 198, \"C0185115;T061;129415008,62972009\", \"extraction\"], [219, 219, \"C0220931;T065;118629009\", \"training\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[4, 4, \"C0006935;T122;385049006\", \"Capsule\"], [7, 7, \"C5203670;T047;840539006\", \"COVID-19\"], [8, 9, \"C0039985;T060;399208008\", \"chest X-ray\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["62972009", "52925006", "118629009", "439401001", "385049006", "129415008", "233604007", "399208008", "13543005", "840539006"], "id": "73be40c6-0dda-4fe4-afc6-10999388e2e8", "_version_": 1725432035512680449}, {"pmid": "34891735", "title": ["Automatic and Robust Identification of Spontaneous Coughs from COVID-19 Patients."], "abstract": ["Cough is one of the most common symptoms of COVID-19.

If this is the only way to prevent self-removal, physical restraint of the patient is required. Furthermore, it is currently necessary to reduce human-to-human contact to prevent COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the development of a sensor system to prevent self-removal of a catheter and reduce human-to-human contact is urgent. The purpose of this study is to examine a sensor system that detects the contact of a patient's hand to a peripheral intravenous catheter in order to prevent self-removal in patients with dementia. This study analyzes the use of a capacitance sensor and an energization sensor to detect the contact of a patient's hand to a catheter. Additionally, the time required from the start of peeling the sensor sheet to the removal of the needle was measured. As the results, the capacitance sensor was difficult to use in a clinical setting because the connection between the seat and cable could be unstable depending on the condition of the connections. The energization sensor was able to recognize the contact of a hand to the catheter by detecting its contact with the sensor. It took at least 28 seconds from detection of the hand contact to the beginning of needle removal. Therefore, it is possible for the caregiver to visit the patient's bedside and stop the self-removal when the sensor sheet detects hand contact. This study is the first step in developing the system that prevents self-removal by detecting hand contact and requires several more steps for clinical use. In the future, we will conduct surveys on more subjects and clinical trials on elderly with dementia to examine accuracy, precision, and repeatability. Using the energization sensor, a self-removal prevention system for dementia patients will be further developed.Clinical Relevance- Developing this self-removal prevention system in the future will allow many dementia patients to no longer be physically restrained, and it will make it possible to remotely detect their actions to prevent self-removal while also minimizing the risk of COVID-19 infection."], "journal": "Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc", "journal_id": "101763872", "date": "2021-12-11T00:00:00Z", "abstract_sen": "[0, 21, 37, 50, 69, 102, 126, 146, 178, 200, 218, 241, 266, 289, 346]", "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[30, 31, \"C0035260;T061;386423001\", \"physical restraint\"], [48, 48, \"C5203670;T047;840539006\", \"COVID-19\"], [49, 49, \"C0009450;T047;189822004,40733004,191415002\", \"infection.\"], [87, 87, \"C1281583;T023;302539009\", \"hand\"], [101, 101, \"C0497327;T048;52448006\", \"dementia.\"], [122, 122, \"C1281583;T023;302539009\", \"hand\"], [140, 140, \"C0015252;T061;118292001,129303008\", \"removal\"], [153, 153, \"C0332218;T033;52925006\", \"difficult\"], [170, 170, \"C0443343;T033;263922001\", \"unstable\"], [189, 189, \"C1281583;T023;302539009\", \"hand\"], [210, 210, \"C1281583;T023;302539009\", \"hand\"], [217, 217, \"C0015252;T061;118292001,129303008\", \"removal.\"], [239, 239, \"C1281583;T023;302539009\", \"hand\"], [256, 256, \"C1281583;T023;302539009\", \"hand\"], [277, 278, \"C0008976;T062;110465008\", \"clinical trials\"], [282, 282, \"C0497327;T048;52448006\", \"dementia\"], [295, 295, \"C0199176;T061;169443000,360271000\", \"prevention\"], [298, 298, \"C0497327;T048;52448006\", \"dementia\"], [308, 308, \"C0199176;T061;169443000,360271000\", \"prevention\"], [316, 316, \"C0497327;T048;52448006\", \"dementia\"], [344, 344, \"C5203670;T047;840539006\", \"COVID-19\"], [345, 345, \"C0009450;T047;189822004,40733004,191415002\", \"infection.\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[]", "snomed_codes": ["189822004", "191415002", "40733004", "52925006", "118292001", "52448006", "360271000", "302539009", "110465008", "386423001", "169443000", "129303008", "263922001", "840539006"], "id": "5223a651-ea47-48f4-a446-359bdc524c22", "_version_": 1725432038316572672}, {"pmid": "34891759", "title": ["Feature Augmented Hybrid CNN for Stress Recognition Using Wrist-based Photoplethysmography Sensor."], "abstract": ["Stress is a physiological state that hampers mental health and has serious consequences to physical health.

To combat respiratory infectious diseases and assist sampling, robots have been utilized and shown promising potentials.

In this study, we proposed two recyclable and cost-efficient end-effector designs that can be equipped at the distal end of a robot to passively regulate or actively sense the force exerted onto patients. One way is to introduce passive compliant mechanisms with soft material to increase the flexibility of the swabbing system, while the other way is utilizing a force-sensing gripper with embedded optoelectronic sensors to actively sense the force or torque. The proposed designs were modelled computationally and tested experimentally. It is identified that the passive compliant mechanisms can increase the flexibility of the swabbing system when subjected to the lateral force and mitigate the vertical force resulted from buckling. The lateral force range that the force-sensing gripper can detect is 0-0.35 N and the vertical force range causing buckling effect that can be sensed by gripper is 1.5-2.5 N."], "journal": "Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc", "journal_id": "101763872", "date": "2021-12-11T00:00:00Z", "abstract_sen": "[0, 22, 38, 60, 93, 132, 141, 171, 201]", "abstract_snomed_ents": "[[1, 1, \"C5203670;T047;840539006\", \"COVID-19\"], [13, 13, \"C0441621;T060;257915005\", \"sampling\"], [19, 19, \"C0220908;T060;20135006\", \"screening\"], [21, 21, \"C0011900;T060;439401001\", \"diagnosis.\"], [25, 26, \"C0009450;T047;189822004,40733004,191415002\", \"infectious diseases\"], [29, 29, \"C0441621;T060;257915005\", \"sampling,\"], [58, 58, \"C0199219;T058;32750006,129433002\", \"inspection\"], [170, 170, \"C0231748;T184;19352007\", \"buckling.\"], [190, 190, \"C0231748;T184;19352007\", \"buckling\"]]", "title_snomed_ents": "[[7, 7, \"C0441621;T060;257915005\", \"Sampling\"], [11, 12, \"C0009450;T047;189822004,40733004,191415002\", \"Infectious Diseases.\"]]", "snomed_codes": ["189822004", "129433002", "20135006", "40733004", "191415002", "439401001", "257915005", "19352007", "32750006", "840539006"], "id": "4ade5a48-3645-40b9-b2ff-89b2f80c417f", "_version_": 1725432038302941187}, {"pmid": "34888461", "title": ["Clinical perception of effectiveness of virtual appointments and comparison with appointment outcomes at a specialist children's hospital."], "abstract": ["Introduction: A transition from face-to-face to virtual consultations occurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Evaluation of outcome data is essential for future healthcare modelling. \nMethods: Clinicians at a children's hospital evaluated perceptions of face-to-face video and telephone appointments by questionnaire. Responses were compared with operational outcomes from June 2019 and June 2020. \nResults: Ninety-three clinicians responded from 28 subspecialties. Virtual consultations increased from 6% (2019) to 67% (2020). No differences were found between appointment types for recording a medical and social history; a significant difference (p<0.001) was seen for the perceived ability to detect clinical signs, organise investigations and make a diagnosis. The proportion of appointments resulting in discharge compared with face-to-face visits was unchanged. The proportion of patients requiring further contact increased from 35% (32% face-to-face and 3% telephone) to 46% (14% face-to-face; 21% telephone and 11% video; chi-squared 426; p<0.0001).The percentage of patients offered an appointment following two 'was not brought' appointments increased from 71% (2019) to 81% (2020) and was most common following telephone appointments (20% face-to-face, 43% telephone and 18% video; chi-squared 474; p<0.0001). \nConclusion: The perception of clinicians is that virtual appointments enabled continuity of paediatric care with improved clinical assessment capability and attendance during video consultations compared with telephone consultations. \n\u00a9 Royal College of Physicians 2021.
